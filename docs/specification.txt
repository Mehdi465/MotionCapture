1)
- The program should run in real time (a small delay is accepted < 0.3s)
- The animator should place rig manually on the model
- It should track only the face in a first iteration

2)
- It should be able to cope with multiple cameras
- It should easily fit inside the blender environment
- It should track the whole body

3)
- It can record and store an animation
- From a recorded chore, it smoothes/filter gesture to have a smooth result (or maybe in RT with a small delay)
- it should track the face and the body at the same time
