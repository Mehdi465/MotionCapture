Assuming that get_position is done

1) get familiar with blender API : the objective is to create a panel with option that can be used, such as record animation, choose filter.
Among blender api features, those needs to be studied:
    - Edit any data the user interface can (Scenes, Meshes, Particles etc.).
    ~ Modify user preferences, keymaps and themes.*
    - Run tools with own settings.
    - Create user interface elements such as menus, headers and panels
    - Create new tools.
    - Create interactive tools

2) See how to link script and metaring object
3) implement record and store animation
4) get familiar with filter for position
